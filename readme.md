# Connect Rusty for the Command-Line. 🦀🦀🦀🦀

## About

* * *

`Connect Rusty` is a fun little game of connect four written in `Rust`. Gain the ability
to play connect four with some rusty crabs from within the command-line.

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a
Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board
game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs
into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is
to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own
discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the
right moves.
